A particular painting, Zeta by Louis Morris, caught our eyes. The scale of the piece and the way the shapes and colors converged reminded us of the new love we were building and it quickly became one of our favorite pieces.",

Rosy continued her education and will receive her Master's in Learning Sciences right before the wedding. Owen became a pre-teen and discovered new hobbies and talents, in addition to making the honor roll. Stevie learned to sit and thrived at day care.
